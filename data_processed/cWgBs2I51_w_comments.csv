The idea was to fine tune a system already rich in energy, chemistry, and purpose. Instead, the summer transfer window turned into a full scale overhaul that cost the club more than £450 million and dismantled much of what made Liverpool unique.

One of the most damaging mistakes was letting Luis Diaz leave. It was no secret that Diaz was earning significantly less than several teammates, including those on the bench, despite being one of the few consistently delivering results. His work ethic, resilience, and ability to lift team morale were invaluable. Rather than rewarding that commitment, the club allowed contract negotiations to stall, refusing to bring his salary in line with his contributions.

Now Diaz is thriving at Bayern Munich, where he has helped the team remain undefeated in the Bundesliga. His creativity, intensity, and contagious enthusiasm have not only elevated Bayern’s play but also highlighted what Liverpool has lost both on the field and in spirit.

Liverpool, by contrast, looks flat and disjointed. The supposed rebuild under Slot has yet to produce cohesion or results. The chemistry Klopp’s side once had, that collective spark, seems to have gone with Diaz. What was promised as evolution has felt more like dismantling, and Slot is left trying to justify decisions that contradict his own opening statements about continuity and legacy.

Liverpool’s loss has become Bayern’s gain, and for all the talk about long term vision, the failure to retain one of their most dynamic players may prove to be the defining mistake of Slot’s first actual season.",0.695

Mo Salah was in my fantasy team last year, carried my team to a high finish. I can't help but feel bad for the dude. He has physically dropped off since after the Christmas period last season. Must be tough to go through this after getting such a massive contract. Wonder if the passing of his dear friend Jota also may be weighing on him.
