Check out all of his “world class” assists. Nothing out of the ordinary and surprise surprise he ghosted against Liverpool and Tottenham😂. Passing the football back has always been his style he just had a free role at Villa to do what he wanted even if he gave the ball away over and over. Stevie Wonder could make the assists he’s making. Oh but I thought G/A didn’t define a player like Grealish? City fans only have a soft spot for him because of that one Arsenal/Liverpool game in the treble season. Did f all the rest of the season but I will say his work rate was the only positive.

The most recent games i’ve seen against fulham, city, tottenham, and palace. I don’t look into stats very often however just off the eye test you can tell Grealish isn’t “doing the exact same thing” he did at City. Someone else under this thread put some stats up if you want to take a look but just off watching the games you can tell grealish is willing to carry the ball more and take risks like he did once at villa, as you said. At city he continuously passed the ball back or went with simple options because the system was built on maintaining possession in order to create the best opportunities to score, this lowered his confidence and he turned into a pass and move player who didn’t take players on anymore. You mentioned how he was given the license to roam free at Villa and this was what made him stand out or look better than he was, but managers only give players the freedom to roam when they’re technically gifted and smart enough to pick up the right position and create chances. Which grealish did at Villa. You can argue it all you want but the people know it, you know it, Grealish at City and Villa were night and day.

These two goals aren’t even remotely comparable. In no way is Bernardo interfering with play. He’s already crouched down and Sa’s vision isn’t being obstructed.
