It’s a completely irrelevant statement.

If you win the title you are naturally in the right moment in the right place - you won the title. Completely obvious statement. 

When you consider what he’s implying by it: 

You can’t just pick the lowest title winning season and say ‘every team who beat that point tally should have won a PL’

Context is kind of a factor here - strength of opponents, injuries, change of personnel and managers and how they work etc. 

Liverpool may not have had much real competition during the latter end of last season, where they played as poorly as beginning of this season and got away with it, but each time they came second Man City were also on fire basically in their prime era.

Arsenal have no teams winning consistently this season. Liverpool have totally folded at least temporarily and city are not yet winning consistently enough, hopefully they make it a tight race though.

Back to the topic, yeah you have to be at the right place at the right time but some places are easier or harder to reach at certain times. 

Liverpool got a fairly easy title but other than Rodri being injured that is not their fault. 

Arsenal getting the same if not easier this season but at least Liverpool got some solid excuses with all the changes imo. 

Liverpool and Man City duking it out for the title was different though - both teams were in their prime at the same time. Arsenal are peaking on their own.",KPz1ZgocW8c,0.6716
